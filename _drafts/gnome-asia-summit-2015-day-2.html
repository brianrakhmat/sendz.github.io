<p>The second day of conference, last day of event. I'm too tired to save all the event to my memory, so this post will not as long as Day 1 or Day 0 post.</p>
<h3>Main Event</h3>
<p>The main event is not at day 0 or even day 1, it's on day 2. <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/kittykat/" target="_blank">Kate</a> and <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/muelli/" target="_blank">Tobi</a> gave a discussion after their speech, and also sponsor gave participants who asked a question a gift, a pair of shoes! Thanks to <a href="http://www.fans.co.id/" target="_blank">FANS</a>Â for the shoes!</p>
